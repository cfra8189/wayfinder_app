an Electronic Press Kit (EPK) serves as your professional resume for the music industry. It must be hosted as a web-based page or a well-organized digital folder (not a massive PDF) to ensure it is mobile-friendly and easy to update. 
Essential EPK Components
Artist Biography: Provide three versions—a short "elevator pitch" (50–100 words), a medium bio (150–250 words) for press, and a long bio for in-depth features. Always write in the third person so journalists can easily copy and paste it.
Curated Music: Feature 3–5 of your best tracks. Leading with your strongest or most popular song is critical; industry pros often decide within the first 15–60 seconds.
Professional Photos: Include 3–5 high-resolution (300 DPI) images. Provide multiple formats: landscape, portrait, and square. Current 2026 trends favor cinematic photography with raw energy over hyper-filtered perfection.
Video Content: Include 2–3 video links, prioritizing high-quality live performance footage to show your stage presence, and official music videos to show your brand aesthetic.
Press & Achievements: Showcase "social proof" such as notable press quotes, awards, or impressive streaming and social media statistics.
Technical Rider & Stage Plot: Essential for venue bookers, this document details your input list, equipment needs, and stage setup.
Contact Information: Clearly list the best point of contact for booking and press inquiries, including a dedicated professional email address. 
2026 Design Trends to Consider
"Imperfect by Design": Modern EPKs are moving away from sterile, over-polished layouts toward maximalism, layered mixed-media collages, and custom illustrated icons that feel more human and authentic.
Tactile Visuals: Designs that mimic texture (glassy, waxy, or organic grains) are increasingly popular to grab attention in a digital space. 
Top Hosting Platforms
Dedicated Music Builders: Bandzoogle, Sonicbids, or ReverbNation.
