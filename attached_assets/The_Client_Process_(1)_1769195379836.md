My Client Collaboration Process 

After turning Prospects in to Clients/Users

I turn them into code

After every session, the client will get:

1. Client folder \- It is updated after every session  
   1. Session document (index.html)  
   2. Reference Folder  
   3. Projects Folder  
   4. Brand Document (style.css)  
   5. Content Document ([script.js](http://script.js))  
   6. Completed Content Folder  
   7. Intellectual Property Folder  
      1. Documentation:  
         1. Registration  
         2. Metadata  
         3. Important Documents:  
            1. Split Sheets  
            2. Signed \- Agreements  
            3. Drafted \- Agreements
