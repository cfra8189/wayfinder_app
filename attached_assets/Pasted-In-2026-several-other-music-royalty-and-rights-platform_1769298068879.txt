In 2026, several other music royalty and rights platforms use submission methods similar to the Harry Fox Agency (HFA), emphasizing bulk templates (Excel) and industry-standard file formats like CWR (Common Works Registration).
1. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC)
The MLC is the primary body for collecting digital mechanical royalties in the U.S. It offers three submission methods: 
Bulk Work Registration: A downloadable Excel-based template used to upload multiple songs at once.
Common Works Registration (CWR): The preferred global standard for large-scale catalog ingestion.
Individual Registration: A manual entry option within the MLC Portal. 
2. Performance Rights Organizations (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) 
These organizations collect performance royalties for songwriters. While they offer manual portals, they use a shared system for bulk data: 
MusicMark: A joint registration platform for ASCAP, BMI, and SOCAN that uses CWR or Electronic Batch Registration (EBR) via a standardized spreadsheet.
CWR Support: High-volume publishers primarily use CWR files to register works across these societies simultaneously. 
3. Music Reports (MRI)
Music Reports manages licensing for platforms like TikTok and Amazon Music. They use a proprietary registry called Songdex: 
Songdex Excel Catalog Template: Used to register recordings and compositions in bulk via email.
CWR/MWN: They also accept industry-standard CWR or MWN (Music Work Notification) formats. 
4. SoundExchange
SoundExchange collects digital performance royalties for masters (not compositions). Their submission process mirrors the others: 
ISRC Ingest Form: A specialized Excel spreadsheet for bulk submission of ISRC codes and recording data.
Licensee Direct Portal: An online hub for uploading these files or entering individual claims.

So the technical formats are CWR, MWN, ASCII, and CSV?
Yes, those are the primary technical formats used for registering music metadata across the industry in 2026. However, they serve very different roles in the submission process.
1. CWR (Common Works Registration)
Role: The "gold standard" for music publishing.
Use Case: Used by publishers to submit large catalogs of compositions to agencies like HFA, The MLC, and ASCAP/BMI.
Format: A highly technical, machine-readable text file (typically version 2.1 or 2.2). It cannot be easily edited by hand and usually requires specialized software to generate. 
2. MWN (Music Work Notification)
Role: Part of the DDEX (Digital Data Exchange) standards.
Use Case: Often used for communication between publishers and societies to synchronize work information. It is designed to be more modern and flexible than CWR, supporting detailed instrumentation and usage data. 
3. ASCII and CSV
Relationship: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a specific type of ASCII (plain text) file.
Role: These are the "flat-file" formats used for most bulk upload templates.
Use Case:
CSV: The format most platforms (like SoundExchange or The MLC) use for their downloadable Excel-style templates.
ASCII: A broader category for any plain text file (.txt, .dat) that can be imported into databases or spreadsheets for royalty tracking. 
Which one should you use?
For Independent Artists/Small Publishers: You will almost always use CSV (via Excel templates) because it is user-friendly and doesn't require complex software.
For Large Publishers: You will likely use CWR or MWN to automate the registration of thousands of tracks simultaneously across global societies.
