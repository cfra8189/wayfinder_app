# WayfinderOS - REVERIE Creative Development Platform

## Overview

WayfinderOS is a terminal-style web application that serves as a creative development assistant for LUCTHELEO's REVERIE | RVR creative consultancy. The platform implements a unique "HTML/CSS/JS" metaphorical framework for artist development:

- **HTML** = Core identity (the authentic self, purpose, the "why")
- **CSS** = Presentation (visual identity, aesthetics, brand image)
- **JS** = Function (market operation, how work reaches audiences)

The application provides a command-line interface for accessing creative development tools, agreement templates, session tracking, and client management resources. The philosophy is "No ego. Just work." - focused on systematic transformation of creative concepts into organized, documented results.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pattern**: Static HTML/CSS/JS served from Express
- **UI Paradigm**: Terminal/command-line aesthetic with CRT visual effects
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with retro terminal styling, scanlines overlay, and accent colors (#c3f53c green)
- **Location**: `/public` directory contains all frontend assets

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js (v5.x) with ES modules
- **Pattern**: Simple REST API with static file serving
- **Entry Point**: `server.js` serves both API routes and static files
- **Port**: 5000

### API Structure
- `POST /api/command` - Processes terminal commands (help, status, generator, admin, etc.)
- `POST /api/admin/login` - Admin authentication with session management
- `POST /api/admin/logout` - End admin session
- `GET /api/admin/check` - Verify admin authentication status
- Static JSON data store at `/public/data.json` for templates and framework definitions

### Agreement Generator
- **Location**: `/generator.html` - Client-facing agreement creation tool
- **3-Step Flow**: Select agreement type → Fill in details → View/Download
- **PDF Export**: Client-side PDF generation using jsPDF library
- **11 Agreement Types**: Split sheets, licenses (basic/standard/premium), production, confidentiality, content release, exclusive license, buyout, coaching

### Data Storage
- **Current**: File-based JSON (`data.json`) containing agreement templates and framework definitions
- **Admin Data**: Client/session data stored in localStorage (prototype phase)
- **No Database**: Simple prototype without persistent server-side storage
- **Client Data Model**: Conceptual folder structure for clients (session docs, brand documents, IP folders)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Terminal UI over Traditional GUI**
   - Chosen for distinctive brand identity and developer-friendly aesthetic
   - Aligns with the systematic, "code-like" approach to creative development
   - Provides focused, distraction-free interaction

2. **ES Modules**
   - Modern JavaScript with `"type": "module"` in package.json
   - Clean import/export syntax throughout

3. **Static Data Files**
   - Agreement templates stored as JSON for easy updates
   - No database complexity for prototype phase
   - Templates include: Split Sheets, Production Agreements, Confidentiality, Content Release
